Engineered T cell receptor (TCR)-expressing T (TCR-T) cells are intended to drive strong anti-tumor responses upon recognition of the specific cancer antigen, resulting in rapid expansion in the number of TCR-T cells and enhanced cytotoxic functions, causing cancer cell death. However, although TCR-T cell therapy against cancers has shown promising results, it remains challenging to predict which patients will benefit from such therapy. We develop a mathematical model to identify mechanisms associated with an insufficient response in a mouse cancer model. We consider a dynamical system that follows the population of cancer cells, effector TCR-T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and “non-cancer
-killing” TCR-T cells. We demonstrate that the majority of TCR-T cells within the tumor are “non-cancer-killing” TCR-T cells, such as exhausted cells, which contribute little or no direct cytotoxicity in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We also establish two important factors influencing tumor regression: the reversal of the immunosuppressive TME following depletion of Tregs and the increased number of effector TCR-T cells with antitumor activity.Using mathematical modeling, we show that specific parameters, such as increasing the cytotoxicity of effector TCR-T cells and modifying the number of TCR-T cells, play essential roles in determining outcomes.
